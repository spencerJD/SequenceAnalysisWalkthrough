#Workflow for Sequencing Pipeline

##Downloading Links to Sequences

* First, you will receive an email from Peter Schweitzer with links to your sequences.
* Expect 4 files in Peter's email:
  * Forward Indices
  * Reverse Indicies
  * Forward Reads
  * Reverse Reads
* Using `wget`, download your files to the sequence directory on the server.
  * [Detailed walkthrough for wget](./DetailedWalkthroughs/wget.md)

NOTE: At this point, raw read QC analysis can be performed. Refer to the `raw_read_QC` Jupyter Notebook in the `fullCyc` dataset for these commands.
